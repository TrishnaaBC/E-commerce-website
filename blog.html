		<h1 >Effect of Technoloy on business of the company</h1><br><br><br>
		<!-- adding text -->
		<p>Technology is a purposeful application of information in the design, production and utilization of goods and services and in the organization of human activities.Businesses have been at the forefront of technology for ages. Whatever can speed production will draw in more business.As information travels faster and faster and more reliably, barriers of distance disappear and businesses are realizing how easy it is to outsource jobs overseas such as hiring employees who work outside the company and even halfway accross the world. Companies can outsource duties such as computer programming and telephone customer service.</p><br><br><p>Technoloy is all around these days, and it's hard to ignore its impact on various areas of our lives. Business is one of the fields that have benefited the most from recent technological advancements and in fact, many areas of business have seen significant growth in the last few decades. The most obvious product of modern technology is the ubiquity of mobile devices all around us. Mobility is the new trend today, and all major manufacturers are aligning their products to this trend in order to ensure that they will always be actively involved in the lives of their customers.It’s now easier than ever to segment your customer groups and figure out how to target specific ones more adequately. We can see some very predictable results with relatively little effort if you use the right kind of technology.</p><br><br>

		<p>Whether it’s connecting a business owner to their employees, or connecting those employees to each other, it’s hard to deny that communication has taken on a new form today thanks to modern technology. Businesses also have easier and more convenient access to a variety of services and products that can benefit them. Pay off debt is easier than ever, and it doesn’t take a lot of effort to compare the best deals on the market, which is quite important. Thanks to various technological advancements, we no longer have to invest huge sums of money to see relatively underwhelming results. We can get a much better return on each investment, either because we’ll have access to more and better information, or because we’ll be in full control of your operations. We will also be able to take advantage of various opportunities to save money in our operations with the help of modern technology.</p>
		<br><br>

		<p>Technology has also provided us with a variety of tools that improve our productivity and allow companies to perform better in every aspect. Technology including everything from physical devices to information technology networks has a deeply transformative influence on the modern world and economy. From changing consumer preferences to reshaping the way businesses produce and market goods, technology can be seen even in the smallest details of day-to-day business operations, increasing the productivity of workers and investments, accelerating economic activity, promoting interdependence between industries and allowing for the continual deployment of new technologies. Technologies like online customers service and customer support pages also reduce the need for personal attention and increase the productivity of investments in these areas without sacrificing customer experience. Whether through faster airplanes or online data transfers, technology tends to accelerate the rate of business operation. What once took weeks through the mail or face-to-face interactions can now be accomplished in seconds with a keystroke. Online money transfers, Web purchasing and Internet file sharing all tend to accelerate the production cycle, making the capitalization, production, sale and distribution of goods considerably faster. Technology like Internet video conferencing and instant access to economic data from around the world makes it just as feasible to conduct business or make investments in a neighboring town as doing so on another continent. Technology facilitates this integration and interdependence through improvements in transportation and communications. As technological innovation makes consumers want new types of products, businesses have to adjust their operations to meet new market demands. Businesses integrate new technologies, such as computers and software packages, into their daily operations and production cycle and provide new products such as increased mobile compatibility for a line of electronics.</p><br><br>

		<p>Although adopting new technology can be very beneficial even necessary for a business, every new technology also presents a unique set of new risks. Without proper employee training in how to use a new software system, for example, technology can actually decrease productivity and even reduce employee satisfaction. The rapid migration of personal and corporate operations data to online databases also makes companies more vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can adversely affect operations or shut down a business altogether.</p><br><br><br>
